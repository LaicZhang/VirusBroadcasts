# VirusBroadcasts

A python virus broadcast simulation, inspired by VirusBroadcast. And I made some changes.

why I name it as `VirusBroadcasts`?

I think this plague can be described as 'Virus Broad casts' instead of 'Virus Broad cast'.

## Usage

### vscode

run `main.py`

### pycharm

- First of all, you should open pycharm, Click on: `setting` -> `Python Scientific` -> cancel `Show plots in tool window`.

- run 'main.py'
